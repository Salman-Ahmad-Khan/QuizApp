Java Swing and AWT are two libraries in Java that allow developers to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for desktop applications.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):

AWT is one of the oldest GUI libraries in Java.
It provides a set of classes and methods to create GUI components like buttons, text fields, and windows.
AWT components are platform-dependent, meaning they may look and behave differently on different operating systems.
While AWT is lightweight and part of the core Java library, its limitations, and platform-specific behavior make it less popular for modern GUI development.
Swing:

Swing is an extension of AWT and is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC).
It provides a more robust and platform-independent way to create GUIs.
Swing components are entirely written in Java and do not rely on the underlying operating system, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.
Swing offers a wide range of customizable components, such as buttons, dialogs, and tables, making it suitable for creating modern and complex GUI applications.
It supports look and feel (L&F) customization, allowing developers to change the appearance of applications.
In summary, Swing is a more powerful and versatile GUI library compared to AWT, making it the preferred choice for most Java desktop application developers. It provides a rich set of components and better cross-platform compatibility, making it easier to create user-friendly and visually appealing applications.
